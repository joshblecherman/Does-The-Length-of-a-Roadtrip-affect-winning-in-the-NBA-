    "\n",

    "###### An n game road trip may be a fraction of a larger road trip. For example, a 5 game road trip consists of a 4 game road trip, a 3 game road trip, etc...\n",
    "###### Therefore, when I refer to a n game road trip, it does not imply that the n + 1 game is a home game. \n",
    "###### However, all road trips start from the first away game following a home game. For example, the last 3 games of a 5 game road trip is not a 3 game road trip. However, the first 3 games of a 5 game road trip is a 3 game road trip. \n",
    "###### All travel distances are approximated as the distance between the home cities of each team. For example, If the 76ers played an away  game against the Celtics, the distance traveled would be estimated as the distance between Philadelphia and Boston, according to this API: https://www.distance24.org/api.xhtml\n",
