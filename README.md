The main goal of this project is to analyze two variables and to see how they correlate to winning in the NBA. The first of these variables is the length of a roadtrip, or any number of consecutive away games following a home game. The second variable is the cumulative distance traveled during a road trip. For example, the cumulative distance traveled during the 76ers first 3 game road trip of the 2018-2019 season was against the Grizzlies, the Heat, and the Magic, so the cumulative distance of that road trip is the distance between Philly and Memphis, plus the distance between Memphis and Miami, plus the distance between Miami and Orlando, which comes out to 3155 km. More information about these variables can be found in the travelling v winnning.ipynb. My hypothesis was that the longer the road trip, the less a team wins. My results are stored in the travelling v winnning.ipynb. 

The secondary goal of this project was to observe any idiosyncrasies in the data. For example, did you know the longest roadtrip in the 2010s belong to the Clippers at 11 games, and the 76ers at over 13,000 km travelled? 
 
The secondary goal of this project was to observe any idiosyncrasies in the data. For example, did you know the longest roadtrip since the 2015-16 season belongs to the nets, at 9 games?
